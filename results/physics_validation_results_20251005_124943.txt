COMPREHENSIVE VORTEX CANNON PHYSICS VALIDATION
Analyzing current implementation vs realistic physics requirements
All theory references documented in code for verification

================================================================================
BASELINE SIMULATION vs REALISTIC PHYSICS COMPARISON
================================================================================
METHODOLOGY NOTE:
  Baseline = Monte Carlo simulation with 50J damage threshold
  Realistic = Theoretical corrections with 750-3000J thresholds
  This comparison demonstrates the performance gap, not fully-integrated physics

Initial vortex ring parameters:
  Velocity: 50.0 m/s
  Diameter: 0.3 m
  Initial energy (slug model): 26 J
  Paper uses slug model (26J) for conservative analysis

PHYSICS COMPARISON RESULTS:
Scenario             Range Baseline_50J Realistic_750J+ Energy_Req Analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Small drone, 15m     15    0.121        0.001           750       INEFFECTIVE
Small drone, 25m     25    0.094        0.000           750       INEFFECTIVE
Medium drone, 20m    20    0.021        0.000           1500      INEFFECTIVE
Large drone, 20m     20    0.003        0.000           3000      INEFFECTIVE
Any drone, 35m       35    0.047        0.000           750       INEFFECTIVE

KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BASELINE AND REALISTIC:
+ Energy threshold: Baseline 50J vs Realistic 750-3000J
+ Targeting accuracy: Baseline perfect vs Realistic range-dependent
+ Vulnerability: Baseline optimistic vs Realistic conservative structural
+ Effective range: Baseline allows 100m+ vs Realistic 20-25m max

CONCLUSION: Realistic physics corrections show system is ineffective
            Energy delivery insufficient by 29-115x for structural damage

ENGAGEMENT CALCULATOR STATUS:
  Max range corrected (<=30m): True
    Current max range: 25.0m
  Kill threshold corrected (>=0.2): True
    Current threshold: 0.3
  Accuracy penalty implemented: True

MULTI-CANNON INTERFERENCE PHYSICS - THEORETICAL ANALYSIS
================================================================================
IMPORTANT: Multi-cannon system not implemented in current codebase
The following analysis is THEORETICAL based on fluid dynamics principles:

Cannons Naive_Energy Theory_Energy  Efficiency  Physics_Basis
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1       2000         2000           1.000       No interference
2       4000         2100           0.525       Theory: 48% loss
3       6000         2100           0.350       Theory: 65% loss
4       8000         2400           0.300       Theory: 70% loss

THEORETICAL BASIS (NOT VALIDATED):
+ Widnall & Sullivan (1973): Vortex ring instability theory
+ Batchelor (1967): Multi-body vortex interaction theory
+ Result: Predicted 20-40% energy loss per additional cannon
+ Status: THEORETICAL ONLY - requires experimental validation

CONCLUSION: Multi-cannon development not recommended due to:
- Single cannon energy deficit (26J vs 750-3000J required)
- Theoretical interference effects would worsen performance
- Resources better spent on alternative technologies
